# Issue Report: Flutter Build Errors

Date: 2025-01-08
Author: CodeDiagnostics-CC

## Summary
Multiple compilation errors preventing the Flutter application from building, including missing files, package conflicts, deprecated APIs, and configuration issues.

## Symptoms
The `flutter run` command fails with the following error categories:
1. File not found: `lib/screens/splash/splash_screen.dart`
2. Type errors in `ai_service.dart`: `InferenceModel`, `ModelFileManager` not found
3. Import conflict: `Message` imported from both local model and flutter_gemma
4. Type mismatch: `CardTheme` vs `CardThemeData` in themes configuration
5. Android NDK version mismatch warnings
6. File picker plugin platform implementation warnings

## Affected Components
- **lib/main.dart**: Line 12 imports non-existent SplashScreen
- **lib/services/ai_service.dart**: Lines 13, 14, 35, 95, 131 - flutter_gemma API issues
- **lib/config/themes.dart**: Lines 43, 126 - deprecated CardTheme usage
- **android/app/build.gradle.kts**: NDK version configuration
- **pubspec.yaml**: Asset directory references

## Root Cause Hypothesis

### 1. **Incomplete UI Implementation**
The project documentation indicates UI screens are "in progress". The missing SplashScreen is part of the incomplete UI implementation phase.

### 2. **flutter_gemma Package API Changes**
The flutter_gemma package (v0.2.0) appears to have a different API than expected:
- Missing or renamed types: `InferenceModel`, `ModelFileManager`, `InferenceConfig`
- Conflicting `Message` class that overlaps with the local model
- The implementation in ai_service.dart doesn't match the current flutter_gemma API

### 3. **Flutter SDK Version Incompatibility**
The CardTheme deprecation suggests the code was written for an older Flutter version:
- `CardTheme` constructor with `color` property is deprecated
- Should use `CardThemeData` with proper theme inheritance

### 4. **Android Build Configuration**
The NDK version mismatch indicates:
- Project configured with NDK 26.3.11579264
- Multiple plugins require NDK 27.0.12077973
- The ndkVersion setting in build.gradle.kts needs updating

### 5. **Missing Project Assets**
The pubspec.yaml references asset directories that don't exist:
- `assets/images/`
- `assets/icons/`
- `assets/fonts/CustomIcons.ttf`

## Technical Details

### flutter_gemma API Investigation
Based on the error patterns, the flutter_gemma package likely:
- Uses a different initialization pattern than expected
- Has its own Message class that conflicts with the local model
- May require different configuration approach

### Theme System Changes
Flutter's theme system has evolved:
- Direct color properties on CardTheme are deprecated
- Colors should be derived from the theme's ColorScheme
- CardThemeData should be used instead of CardTheme constructor

## Testing Notes
To verify these issues:
1. Check flutter_gemma package documentation for v0.2.0 API
2. Review Flutter migration guides for theme system changes
3. Validate Android NDK installation and configuration
4. Inspect the actual flutter_gemma source code for correct usage patterns
