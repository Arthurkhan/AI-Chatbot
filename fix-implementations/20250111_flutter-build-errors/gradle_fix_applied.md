# Gradle Build Fix Applied

## Problem Solved
Fixed the critical error: "Dependency ':flutter_local_notifications' requires core library desugaring to be enabled"

## Changes Applied to `/android/app/build.gradle.kts`:

1. **Set explicit SDK versions**:
   - compileSdk = 34
   - minSdk = 21
   - targetSdk = 34

2. **Enabled core library desugaring**:
   ```kotlin
   compileOptions {
       sourceCompatibility = JavaVersion.VERSION_11
       targetCompatibility = JavaVersion.VERSION_11
       isCoreLibraryDesugaringEnabled = true
   }
   ```

3. **Added desugaring dependency**:
   ```kotlin
   dependencies {
       coreLibraryDesugaring("com.android.tools:desugar_jdk_libs:2.1.3")
   }
   ```

4. **Enabled multidex support**:
   ```kotlin
   defaultConfig {
       multiDexEnabled = true
   }
   ```

## Status
- ✅ Core library desugaring issue: FIXED
- ⚠️ file_picker warnings: Still present but NON-CRITICAL (won't prevent build)

## Next Steps
Try running the app again with:
```bash
flutter run
```

The app should now build successfully. The file_picker warnings can be ignored as they only affect desktop platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows) which you're not targeting.
