# Issue Report: Flutter Build Errors

**Title**: Flutter build failure due to record package version incompatibility and file_picker warnings

## Symptoms

When running `flutter run`, the build fails with the following errors:

1. **Multiple warnings (non-critical)**: file_picker plugin reference warnings for linux, macos, and windows platforms
2. **Critical build error**: 
   ```
   ../../../.pub-cache/hosted/pub.dev/record_linux-0.7.2/lib/record_linux.dart:12:7: Error: The non-abstract class 'RecordLinux' is missing implementations for these members:
   - RecordPlatform.startStream
   ```

## Affected Components

- **pubspec.yaml**: Dependencies configuration
- **record package**: Version 5.2.1 with transitive dependency record_linux 0.7.2
- **record_platform_interface**: Version 1.3.0 (requires startStream implementation)
- **file_picker package**: Version 6.2.1 (causing platform warnings)

## Root Cause Hypothesis

1. **Primary Issue**: Version incompatibility between record_linux (0.7.2) and record_platform_interface (1.3.0). The record_linux package hasn't been updated to implement the new `startStream` method required by the platform interface.

2. **Secondary Issue**: file_picker 6.2.1 has known issues with platform-specific plugin configurations for desktop platforms (linux, macos, windows), causing repetitive warnings during build.

## Supporting Evidence

From pubspec.lock:
- record: 5.2.1
- record_linux: 0.7.2 (transitive)
- record_platform_interface: 1.3.0 (transitive)
- file_picker: 6.2.1

The error message clearly indicates that record_platform_interface 1.3.0 expects a `startStream` method that record_linux 0.7.2 doesn't implement.
