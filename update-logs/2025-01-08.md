## Diagnostic Session: Flutter Build Errors

**Session Time**: 2025-01-08
**Author**: CodeDiagnostics-CC

### Summary
Analyzed Flutter build errors preventing application compilation. Identified 5 major issues related to missing UI components, package API conflicts, deprecated theme APIs, and build configuration problems.

### Files Analyzed
- `lib/main.dart` - Missing SplashScreen import
- `lib/services/ai_service.dart` - flutter_gemma API conflicts
- `lib/config/themes.dart` - Deprecated CardTheme usage
- `android/app/build.gradle.kts` - NDK version configuration
- `pubspec.yaml` - Asset directory references

### Issues Identified
1. **Missing SplashScreen**: Referenced in main.dart but file doesn't exist
2. **flutter_gemma API mismatch**: Package types don't match implementation
3. **Message class conflict**: Imported from both local model and flutter_gemma
4. **CardTheme deprecation**: Using deprecated color property
5. **Android NDK version**: Mismatch between project (26.3) and plugins (27.0)

### Report & Roadmap Files
- Issue Report: `fix-implementations/20250108_flutter-build-errors/issue_report.md`
- Fix Roadmap: `fix-implementations/20250108_flutter-build-errors/fix_roadmap.md`

### Questions for User
1. Should we implement a proper SplashScreen or remove it for now?
2. Do you have documentation for the flutter_gemma v0.2.0 API?
3. Are the asset directories (images, icons, fonts) needed immediately?

### Recommendations
- Start with quick fixes to get the app building (remove SplashScreen, update NDK)
- Investigate flutter_gemma documentation for proper API usage
- Consider updating to latest stable versions of dependencies if API conflicts persist
