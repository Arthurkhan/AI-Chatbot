# Update: Android SDK Version Fixes
Date: 2025-01-11

## Summary
Fixed Android build errors by updating SDK versions to meet plugin requirements.

## Changes Made
- **android/app/build.gradle.kts**: Updated Android SDK versions
  - compileSdk: 34 → 35
  - minSdk: 21 → 24
  - targetSdk: 34 → 35

## Technical Details
The build was failing because:
1. Multiple plugins (flutter_sound, geolocator_android, image_picker_android, etc.) require Android SDK 35
2. flutter_sound specifically requires minSdk 24 or higher
3. The project was configured with compileSdk 34 and minSdk 21

The `flutter_sound` package was added as a replacement for the `record` package to fix the previous Linux platform compatibility issue.

## Testing Notes
- Run `flutter clean` before building
- Test on Android device/emulator with API 24 or higher
- The app will no longer support Android devices below API 24 (Android 7.0)
- File picker warnings for desktop platforms are non-critical and can be ignored

## Impact
- **Breaking Change**: Minimum Android version increased from 5.0 (API 21) to 7.0 (API 24)
- This affects approximately 5-8% of Android devices globally (as of 2025)
