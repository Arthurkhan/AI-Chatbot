# Update: Build Error Fixes

## Summary
Fixed multiple build errors related to flutter_gemma API compatibility and Message model implementation.

## Changes Made
- **lib/services/ai_service.dart**: Completely rewrote to use flutter_gemma 0.2.4 API
  - Removed references to non-existent InferenceModel and ModelFileManager classes
  - Implemented using FlutterGemmaPlugin.instance.init() and getChatResponseAsync()
  - Added proper Message construction using flutter_gemma's Message class
  
- **lib/models/message.dart**: Added role getter property
  - Added `String get role => isUser ? 'user' : 'assistant';` for backward compatibility
  
- **lib/screens/chat/chat_screen.dart**: Fixed Message constructor usage
  - Changed from role/timestamp parameters to conversationId/isUser/createdAt
  - Updated message bubble to use isUser property directly

## Technical Details
The main issue was that the code was written for a newer version of flutter_gemma (likely 0.9.0+) while pubspec.yaml specified version 0.2.4. The older version has a simpler API:
- No model management classes
- Simple init() method with modelPath parameter
- Basic Message class with text and isUser properties
- Stream-based response generation

## Testing Notes
- The app should now compile successfully on Android
- One remaining issue: record_linux package has compatibility issues (third-party)
- To fully test: Need to manually download and place Gemma model at /data/local/tmp/llm/model.bin

## Next Steps
1. Consider upgrading flutter_gemma to latest version for better API
2. Fix record package compatibility issue (may need to update or replace)
3. Implement proper model download functionality
4. Test on actual device with model file
