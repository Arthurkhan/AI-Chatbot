# Update: Fixed Core Library Desugaring for flutter_local_notifications
Date: 2025-01-11
Author: Claude

## Summary
Fixed Android build failure by enabling core library desugaring required by flutter_local_notifications package.

## Changes Made
- **android/app/build.gradle.kts**: 
  - Set explicit compileSdk to 34 (instead of flutter.compileSdkVersion)
  - Set explicit minSdk to 21 (instead of flutter.minSdkVersion)
  - Set explicit targetSdk to 34 (instead of flutter.targetSdkVersion)
  - Enabled core library desugaring with `isCoreLibraryDesugaringEnabled = true`
  - Added multidex support with `multiDexEnabled = true`
  - Added desugaring dependency: `com.android.tools:desugar_jdk_libs:2.1.3`

## Technical Details
The flutter_local_notifications package uses Java 8+ features (like java.time API) that aren't available on older Android versions. Core library desugaring allows these modern Java APIs to work on Android API levels below 26.

Key configuration added:
```kotlin
compileOptions {
    isCoreLibraryDesugaringEnabled = true
}

dependencies {
    coreLibraryDesugaring("com.android.tools:desugar_jdk_libs:2.1.3")
}
```

## Testing Notes
- Run `flutter clean` and `flutter pub get` after these changes
- The file_picker warnings are cosmetic and won't prevent the app from running
- The app should now build successfully on Android devices

## Next Steps
- Consider updating file_picker to a newer version (10.x) if the warnings become problematic
- Monitor for any runtime issues related to desugaring on older Android devices
